# Implementation progress

## M1 — Durable end-of-meeting gate

Status: done

Finalized runs now persist a 15-second ASR not-before time; grouped Stop requests are idempotent, and resumed capture invalidates pending work. The worker rechecks finalized audio, capture state, and the current group before preparation and ASR; the Notes surface shows durable countdown/progress and has no early Transcribe control.

Preserved the original mic/system tracks, previous artifacts, no capture-time provider work, and Pause's existing `suppressProcessing` cancellation path. Short usable recordings remain eligible for ASR.

Issues: the first test typecheck found a nullable deadline assertion; the test now asserts the persisted deadline before parsing it. No other implementation issues found.

Root's M1 focused run exposed two test assumptions, with no product-code regression: the renderer harness does not interpolate i18n placeholders, and the missing-key test expected provider validation before the persisted gate elapsed. The assertions now check the visible waiting notice/no-bypass behavior, and the config test advances its controlled clock to the persisted deadline before asserting the blocked provider state. Root should rerun the focused suite.

Verification:

- `pnpm run typecheck:main` — passed.
- `pnpm run typecheck:renderer` — passed.
- `pnpm run typecheck:tests` — passed after adding restart coverage.
- Scoped main/test ESLint — 0 errors; 27 existing unused-symbol warnings in `ipcHandlers.ts` and `meetingCoordinatorIpcHandlers.ts`.
- Scoped renderer ESLint — passed; Node emitted the existing `MODULE_TYPELESS_PACKAGE_JSON` config warning.
- `git diff --check` — passed.
- Required focused tests remain unrun by this agent; root integrator owns test execution. Run: `pnpm test -- test/helpers/meetingProcessing.test.ts test/stores/meetingRecordingStoreAutoEndStop.test.ts test/components/meetingResultsPanel.test.ts`.
- Isolated live-profile/hardware check was not run here.
